::page{title="Build an MCP Application"}

**Estimated time needed:** 30 minutes

This short lab will guide you through building an MCP application that interacts with multiple MCP servers. On the application side, we'll create a [LangGraph ReAct](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/agents/) agent powered by GPT-5 to leverage MCP capabilities in response to user prompts. On the server side, we'll configure prebuilt MCP servers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab you will have:

-   Configured two **MCP servers** ([Context7](https://github.com/mikechao/metmuseum-mcp) and [Met Museum](https://github.com/mikechao/metmuseum-mcp)) with transports via **STDIO and HTTP**
    
    -   Using the `MultiServerMCPClient` from the `langchain-mcp-adapters` library
        
-   Built a [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) ReAct Agent powered by **GPT-5** with chat memory and access to the MCP tools
    
-   Created a looping **CLI tool** to talk to a session-persistent agent that can help you with questions on library documentation and The Metropolitan Museum of Art
    
    -   A weird combination of topics and capabilities but these are for heuristic purposes
        

## Prerequisites

Before performing this lab ensure you have:

-   Access to a modern web browser that can run this page (if you are here already you should be fine)
    
-   Basic Python knowledge
    
-   Basic knowledge of MCP transports and how each type works
    
-   An interest in agentic pattern design
    

## Multi-server MCP Client

Here's a diagram of what our MCP host architecture will look like:

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/livCvmEhvl24XOyqA45Kgg/multi-server-client.png" width="75%" />  

-   We'll use a **multi-server client** that creates two sessions each connecting to different MCP servers
    
-   The Context7 MCP server will be connected via HTTP (remote URL)
    
-   The Met Museum MCP server will be connected via STDIO (download locally, then connect)
    
-   The Met Museum MCP server exposes its tools through **Web APIs** to access The Metropolitan Museum of Art's catalogue
    
-   Context7 provides tools by accessing **remote repositories** of up-to-date documentation
    

## LangChain MCP Adapters

After retrieving tools from our MCP servers, the client makes them available to an agent.

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/RdA1pvh1vdJyiicgXb8u3g/mcp-adapters.png" width="75%" />  

-   The client communicates using the **Model Context Protocol**, so we need a way to make the tools compatible with LangChain
    
-   **LangChain MCP adapters** is a library that converts MCP tools into LangChain-compatible tools
    
-   We'll then integrate these tools into our **LangGraph ReAct Agent**
    

## ReAct Agent

The following diagram shows how our ReAct agent (powered by **GPT-5**) processes a user prompt:

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/LZn04k0bH4Kp1dHKv0kLKQ/react-agent.png" width="75%" />  

-   First, the input is passed to the agent (LLM), which decides which tool is best suited to answer the query
    
-   The agent calls the tool (adapted from the MCP client) and observes the output
    
-   This process **repeats** until the agent determines a final answer, which is then returned to the user
    

Now we're ready to build our application following these three main steps.

::page{title="Setup"}

First, let's create a virtual environment to keep this project's dependencies separate from other Python projects and avoid version conflicts.

Run the following commands to create a virtual environment and source it:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

```

Now let's install the necessary libaries with the command below:

```bash
pip install langgraph==0.6.6
pip install langchain==0.3.27
pip install langchain-openai==0.3.32
pip install langchain-ibm==0.3.18
pip install langchain-mcp-adapters==0.1.9

```

Let's create the necessary files for this project:

```bash
touch main.py

```

Now we can start building the project.

::page{title="Building the Application - Part 1"}

Let's start building our **command line tool** in the `main.py` file. Use the button below to open it.

&nbsp;

::openFile{path="main.py"}

At the top let's import all required libraries and dependencies.

```python
# Standard library imports
import asyncio
# Third-party imports for MCP (Model Context Protocol) and LangGraph
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient # Connects to MCP servers
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent # Creates ReAct-style agents
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver # Provides conversation memory
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI # OpenAI chat model integration
from langchain_ibm import ChatWatsonx # Watsonx chat model if OpenAI gets rate limited

```

## Main Function

The main function serves as the **setup container** for our entire application, initializing and coordinating all components in a logical sequence. This async function is essential because:

-   **Network operations** require async handling (MCP servers, LLM APIs)
    
-   **Component coordination** is required between client, model, and agent setup
    

Without this central function, we'd have disconnected pieces of code with no clear flow.

```python
async def main():
    """
    Main function that sets up and runs an AI agent with access to multiple MCP servers.
    The agent can access Context7 library documentation and Met Museum collections.
    """

```

Everything below will be in the main function, apart from the entry point at the end.

## Multi-server MCP Client

This client acts as the **bridge** between our application and external services, handling complex communication protocols (MCP) automatically. MCP supports multiple transport mechanisms, each optimized for different deployment scenarios.

-   **Context7 MCP server**: Library documentation via HTTP transport
    
    -   **Streamable HTTP transport** enables real-time communication with remote servers
        
    -   **Stateless connection**: each request is independent, perfect for cloud services
        
    -   **Cross-platform compatibility** works from any environment with internet access
        
-   **Metropolitan Museum of Art MCP server**: Art collection data via Node.js **STDIO**
    
    -   **STDIO transport** creates a direct process-to-process communication channel
        
    -   **Local** execution runs the MCP server as a subprocess on the same machine
        
    -   **Persistent connection** maintains state throughout the session
        
    -   **Lower latency** since no network overhead, ideal for local tools and data sources
        
-   **MCP protocol** enables secure tool and data access
    
    -   **Standardized interface**: same client code works with different transport types
        
    -   **Tool discovery** is handled **automatically** regardless of transport method
        
    -   Type-safe tool definitions with automatic **schema validation**
        

The client abstracts away the complexity of connecting to different server types and protocols.

```python
	# Configure MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
    # These servers provide tools that the AI agent can use
    client = MultiServerMCPClient(
        {
            # Context7 server - provides access to library documentation
            "context7": {
                "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",        # Server endpoint
                "transport": "streamable_http",                # Communication protocol
            },
            # Met Museum server - provides access to museum collection data
            "met-museum": {
                "command": "npx",                              # Node.js package runner
                "args": ["-y", "metmuseum-mcp"],              # Install and run met museum MCP
                "transport": "stdio",                         # Communication via stdin/stdout
            }
        }
    )

```

## ReAct Agent Configuration

Here we assemble the intelligence layer that will power our agent's capabilities.

-   `ChatOpenAI`, the **OpenAI LLM** provides reasoning and language understanding
    
-   Tool retrieval from MCP servers for external interactions
    
-   `InMemorySaver` maintains conversation context across interactions
    
-   **Thread configuration** groups messages for session continuity
    

This configuration enables natural, context-aware conversations rather than isolated exchanges.

```python
	# Initialize the OpenAI language model
    # This model will power the AI agent's reasoning and responses
    openai_model = ChatOpenAI(
        model="gpt-5-nano",  # Using OpenAI's GPT-5 Nano model
    )

	# Initialize the Watsonx language model
    # This model will power the AI agent's reasoning and responses if the OpenAI model gets rate limited. Uncomment and use it. 

    #watsonx_model = ChatWatsonx(
    #    model_id="ibm/granite-4-h-small",
    #    url="https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
    #    project_id="skills-network"
    #)
    

    # Retrieve all available tools from the configured MCP servers
    # These tools allow the agent to interact with external services
    tools = await client.get_tools()

    # Set up conversation memory using InMemorySaver
    # This allows the agent to remember previous messages in the conversation
    checkpointer = InMemorySaver()

	# Configuration for conversation persistence
    # The thread_id ensures all messages in this session are grouped together
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "conversation_id"}}

```

## ReAct Agent

The ReAct agent represents the core intelligence of our application, combining reasoning with action.

-   **ReAct = Reasoning + Acting**: thinks through problems then takes action
    
-   Multi-step problem solving using available tools
    
-   Active information gathering through MCP server tools
    
    -   More powerful than simple chatbots that can only respond
        

This agent can both understand complex requests and actively fulfill them through tool usage.

```python
	# Create the ReAct agent with all components
    # ReAct = Reasoning + Acting (agent can reason about and use tools)
    agent = create_react_agent(
        model=openai_model,         # The language model to use, replace with watsonx_model if you receive rate limiting errors
        tools=tools,                # Available tools from MCP servers
        checkpointer=checkpointer   # Memory system for conversation history
    )

```

### Different Clients

### This is a tangent topic - _DO NOT ADD THE NEXT 2 CODE SNIPPETS INTO THE PROJECT_

If you read LangChain MCP adapter's documentation, you may see a different approach of instantiating and invoking a client.

```python
# Create server parameters for stdio connection
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

from langchain_mcp_adapters.tools import load_mcp_tools
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

server_params = StdioServerParameters(
    command="python",
    # Make sure to update to the full absolute path to your math_server.py file
    args=["/path/to/math_server.py"],
)

async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
        # Initialize the connection
        await session.initialize()

        # Get tools
        tools = await load_mcp_tools(session)

        # Create and run the agent
        agent = create_react_agent("openai:gpt-4.1", tools)
        agent_response = await agent.ainvoke({"messages": "what's (3 + 5) x 12?"})

```

This is a lower-level approach that uses modules:

-   `StdioServerParameters`: Parameter schema for a stdio server; `command` and `args` required
    
-   `stdio_client`: Takes the transport parameters and creates an asynchronous client connected to the server with `read`/`write` streams so the client can receive JSON messages over the specified transport: standard I/O
    
-   `ClientSession`: Handles all requests and messages over the input/ouput streams, this includes initializing the handshake, sending requests to the server, receiving responses, managing session states, and cleanup
    

The streamable HTTP version of this looks something like the following:

```python
# Use server from examples/servers/streamable-http-stateless/

from mcp import ClientSession
from mcp.client.streamable_http import streamablehttp_client

from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_mcp_adapters.tools import load_mcp_tools

async with streamablehttp_client("http://localhost:3000/mcp") as (read, write, _):
    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
        # Initialize the connection
        await session.initialize()

        # Get tools
        tools = await load_mcp_tools(session)
        agent = create_react_agent("openai:gpt-4.1", tools)
        math_response = await agent.ainvoke({"messages": "what's (3 + 5) x 12?"})

```

Very similar, just without something like `HTTPServerParameters` because the only parameter is a URL reference to the server so creating its own schema is trivial.

The session and asynchronous context management is all handled internally in `MultiServerMCPClient` so there's less configuration. Each type of client has its advantages and disadvantages, so keep them in mind when creating MCP applications.

::page{title="Building the Application - Part 2"}

## Initial Message

We establish the conversation foundation by setting the agent's role and prompting its introduction.

-   **System message** defines agent's capabilities and personality
    
-   **User message** requests agent to introduce itself and its tools
    
-   **Context setting** to establish chat history for the conversation
    
-   **Tool demonstration** shows user what's available
    

This initial exchange sets the tone and demonstrates the agent's capabilities to the user.

```python
	# Send initial message to introduce the agent and its capabilities
    response = await agent.ainvoke(
        {"messages": [
            # System message defines the agent's role and personality
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a smart, useful agent with tools to access code library documentation and the Met Museum collection."},
            # User message requests the agent to introduce itself
            {"role": "user", "content": "Give a brief introduction of what you do and the tools you can access."},
        ]},
        config=config  # Use the conversation thread for memory persistence
    )
    # Print the agent's response (last message in the conversation)
    print(response['messages'][-1].content)

```

## Command Line Interaction Loop

The interaction loop provides a continuous conversation interface that keeps the session alive.

-   **Menu** user interaction with clear options
    
-   **Smooth** question and answer flow
    
-   **Conversation history** maintained through config parameter
    
-   **Graceful exit** option for clean program termination
    

This loop enables extended, meaningful conversations with full context retention.

```python
	# Main interaction loop - allows continuous conversation with the agent
    while True:
        # Display menu options to the user
        choice = input("""
Menu:
1. Ask the agent a question
2. Quit
Enter your choice (1 or 2): """)

        if choice == "1":
            # Get user's question
            print("Your question")
            query = input("> ")

            # Send the user's question to the agent
            # The agent will have access to the full conversation history
            response = await agent.ainvoke(
                {"messages": query},        # User's current question
                config=config              # Maintains conversation thread
            )
            # Display the agent's response
            print(response['messages'][-1].content)
        else:
            # Exit the program for any choice other than "1"
            print("Goodbye!")
            break

```

## Entry Point

The entry point follows the standard Python pattern for script execution, ensuring proper program startup.

-   `if __name__ == "__main__"` prevents execution when imported
    
-   `asyncio.run()` handles the async main function
    
-   **Program startup** when script executed directly
    

This pattern ensures our code can be both imported as a module and run as a standalone script.

```python
# Entry point - runs the main function when script is executed directly
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Use asyncio to run the async main function
    asyncio.run(main())

```

</details>

Now that our application is built, let's run it and interact with the agent.

::page{title="Run the Application"}

Run the following command to connect to the MCP servers and start the application.

**Useful Note:** Expand the terminal size for a better user experience.

```bash
python main.py

```

On startup, you should see the introduction message that the agent sends. It should detail its capabilities and usage. It should then give you an option menu (the one we created). Select **option 1** and ask the agent a question regarding library documentation or The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

-   Note that every time the agent accesses the Met Museum MCP server, there will be a message such as this `Met Museum MCP server running on stdio` in the command line (you can just ignore it)
    
-   The agent will have conversation history meaning it'll remember previous chats within the same instance of the application being run
    
    -   As you chat more and more, responses will take **longer**
        
-   Remember to select **1** in the menu to continue chatting, or **2** in the menu to quit, after every interaction
    
-   **Be mindful** of the API usage (chats with the agent), you do have a **limit**
    

::page{title="Conclusion"}

🎉 Congratulations! You've just built a complete **MCP-powered LangGraph application** from scratch.

By working through this lab, you have:

-   Configured **two different MCP servers** (Context7 via HTTP and Met Museum via STDIO) inside a single client
    
-   Learned how the `MultiServerMCPClient` abstracts away the complexity of different transport types
    
-   Built a **LangGraph ReAct Agent** powered by GPT-5 that can both reason and take action using tools
    
-   Added **conversation memory** so the agent remembers context across multiple user interactions
    
-   Created a simple but effective **CLI loop** to continuously interact with your agent
    

These are the exact same building blocks you'll see in real-world agentic applications—so you've taken a big step forward in understanding how to wire models, protocols, and tools together.

If you missed a step, don't worry, you can always come back to this lab and try again. Each time you'll reinforce your understanding.

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to connect MCP servers and build a ReAct agent:

-   Try adding **more MCP servers** (for example, one that connects to your own data or APIs)
    
-   Experiment with **different LLMs** (for example, larger GPT-5 variants or open-source models)
    
-   Extend the CLI into a **web app** or **chat interface** so you can interact with the agent more naturally
    
-   Explore **agent patterns** such as planning, multi-step reasoning, or chaining multiple MCP tools for more complex workflows
    

This is just the beginning—you now have the foundation to build intelligent, tool-using agents that can integrate with almost any data source.
